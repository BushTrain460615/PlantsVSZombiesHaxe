# Plants VS Zombies: Haxe Edition

PVZ: Haxe Edition is a port of PVZ (PC Version) in the coding language HaxeFlixel

## Building

Install [Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/) (Download 4.1.5 instead of 4.2.0 because 4.2.0 is broken and is not working with gits properly...) *not stolen from the FNF GitHub, I would do no such thing*

```
I dunno man I'm at school mate
```

There are pre-compiled builds in the [releases](https://github.com/Cheese-Curd/PlantsVSZombiesHaxe/releases) tab. I will keep the old builds so you can experience the old builds lol
